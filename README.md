## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to center a div and contain everything into one div.

### Continued development

I want to keep refining my skills on flexbox, maybe even trying grid so I have an easier time building projects in the future.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](developer.mozilla.org) - Everything that one needs to know about web development can be found here.
